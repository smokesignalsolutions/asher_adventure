# Status Effects & Custom Map Enemies Design

**Date:** 2026-03-25
**Scope:** Unified status effect system, 60 custom map enemies, retrofit all existing enemies with special attacks

---

## 1. Status Effect System

### StatusEffect Model (`lib/models/status_effect.dart`)

New enum `StatusEffectType` and class `StatusEffect`:

```dart
enum StatusEffectType {
  weakened,    // Deal reduced damage
  exposed,     // Reduced defense
  vulnerable,  // Takes bonus damage from all sources (legacy appliesVulnerability)
  slowed,      // Reduced speed
  stunned,     // Lose next turn
  blinded,     // % chance attacks miss
  poisoned,    // Damage each turn
  burning,     // Damage each turn (higher, shorter)
  bleeding,    // Damage each turn
  silenced,    // Only basic attack available
  frozen,      // Stunned + next hit deals bonus damage
  cursed,      // Healing received halved
}

class StatusEffect {
  final StatusEffectType type;
  int duration;          // Turns remaining (-1 = permanent for this combat)
  final int magnitude;   // % for debuffs, flat damage for DoTs
  final String sourceId; // Who applied it
}
```

### Effect Categories & Behavior

**Offensive Debuffs:**
| Type | Effect | Magnitude meaning | Default magnitude |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| weakened | Target deals reduced damage | % damage reduction (e.g., 25 = deals 75% damage) | 25% |
| exposed | Target has reduced defense | % defense reduction | 30% |
| vulnerable | Target takes bonus damage from all sources | Bonus damage % (random roll 5-magnitude%) | 15% |
| slowed | Target has reduced speed | % speed reduction | 30% |

**Damage Over Time (DoTs):**
| Type | Effect | Magnitude meaning | Default magnitude |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| poisoned | Take damage at start of turn | Flat damage per tick | Scales with tier (see below) |
| burning | Take damage at start of turn | Flat damage per tick | Scales with tier (see below) |
| bleeding | Take damage at start of turn | Flat damage per tick | Scales with tier (see below) |

DoT default damage by tier: `tier * 3 + 2` (T1=5, T2=8, T3=11, T4=14, T5=17, T6=20, T7=23, T8=26).

**Control:**
| Type | Effect | Magnitude meaning | Default magnitude |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| stunned | Skip next turn | N/A (binary) | N/A |
| blinded | Attacks have % chance to miss | Miss chance % | 40% |
| silenced | Only basic attack available | N/A (binary) | N/A |
| frozen | Stunned + next hit deals bonus damage | Bonus damage % on next hit | 30% |
| cursed | Healing received halved | N/A (binary) | N/A |

When an ability lists a status effect without an explicit magnitude, use the default magnitude for that type.

### Stacking Rules

- **DoTs stack independently** — a target can have multiple poison instances ticking at once, each with its own damage and duration
- **Control effects refresh** — reapplying stunned/frozen/silenced/blinded resets duration to the new application's value (latest wins)
- **Stat debuffs (weakened, exposed, slowed) stack as separate instances** — each application is tracked independently. At resolution time, use the strongest active magnitude. This means a permanent weakened 25% and a temporary weakened 50% coexist; while the temporary one is active, 50% applies; when it expires, the permanent 25% is still there. This is an intentional change from the old multiplicative stacking — multi-debuff strategies are slightly weaker but more predictable.
- **Vulnerable stacks** — multiple vulnerable applications increase the magnitude (capped at 30%). Duration takes the longer/permanent value.
- **Cursed refreshes** — reapplying cursed resets duration

### Boss Resistance

Bosses have reduced status effect durations: all effects applied to bosses have their duration reduced by 1 (minimum 1). This prevents bosses from being stun-locked or permanently debilitated.

### Processing Order (unified — single source of truth)

**Turn start:**
1. Tick DoTs (poison, burning, bleeding) — apply damage, decrement DoT durations, remove expired DoTs
2. Check stunned/frozen — if active, skip turn, decrement stun/frozen duration, remove if expired, return (skip steps 3-5)

**Action phase** (only reached if not stunned/frozen):
3. Check silenced — filter available abilities to basic attacks only
4. Choose ability (player picks or AI selects)
5. Execute ability (see processAbilityHit / processHeal below)

**End of turn:**
6. Decrement durations of all remaining non-DoT effects (debuffs, control), remove expired ones

**On ability hit (processAbilityHit):**
1. If attacker has blinded — roll miss chance. If miss → log "{name}'s attack misses!", return
2. If target has frozen — apply bonus damage (magnitude %), remove frozen from target
3. If target has vulnerable — roll bonus damage (5% to magnitude%)
4. Calculate damage using target.effectiveDefense (factors in exposed), attacker effective stats (factors in weakened)
5. Apply damage (shield absorbs first, then HP)
6. For each `appliesStatusEffects` on ability → roll chance%, if success → target.addStatusEffect()
7. Log status application: "{target} is {effect}!" for each applied effect

**On heal (processHeal):**
1. If target has cursed — halve the heal amount
2. Apply healing

### Combat Log Messages

Status effects generate log messages at key moments:
- **Applied:** "{Target} is poisoned for 3 turns!"
- **DoT tick:** "Poison deals 11 damage to {Target}!"
- **Stun skip:** "{Target} is stunned and can't act!"
- **Miss (blinded):** "{Attacker}'s attack misses!"
- **Expired:** "{Target} is no longer poisoned."
- **Frozen shatter:** "{Target} takes bonus damage from being frozen!"

### Ability Integration

New field on `Ability`:

```dart
class AppliedEffect {
  final StatusEffectType type;
  final int duration;
  final int magnitude;
  final int chance; // 0-100% chance to apply on hit
}

// On Ability:
List<AppliedEffect> appliesStatusEffects;
```

Each effect rolls independently on hit. Example: Gore Charge has `[{stunned, 1, 0, 60%}, {bleeding, 1, dmg, 80%}]` — might stun but not bleed, or both, or neither.

## 2. Model Migration

### Character (`lib/models/character.dart`)

**Keep as-is (for player buffs and map modifiers):**
- `combatAttackMultiplier` — used by player buff abilities (attackBuffPercent) and map stat modifiers
- `combatDefenseMultiplier` — used by player buff abilities (defenseBuffPercent) and map stat modifiers
- `combatSpeedMultiplier` — used by map stat modifiers
- `combatMagicMultiplier` — used by map stat modifiers
- `combatDefenseBonus` — used by grantCasterDefensePercent
- `shieldHp`, `isFrontLine`, `activeSummons`, `skeletonCount`, `lastAttackWasPhysical` (class mechanic fields)

**Add:**
- `List<StatusEffect> statusEffects`
- Getter `effectiveAttack` — base attack × combatAttackMultiplier, then reduced by weakened effects
- Getter `effectiveDefense` — base defense × combatDefenseMultiplier + combatDefenseBonus, then reduced by exposed effects
- Getter `effectiveSpeed` — base speed × combatSpeedMultiplier, then reduced by slowed effects
- Getter `isStunned` — checks for stunned/frozen effects
- Getter `isSilenced` — checks for silenced effect
- Getter `isBlinded` — checks for blinded effect, returns miss chance %
- Getter `isCursed` — checks for cursed effect
- Getter `isVulnerable` — checks for vulnerable effect, returns magnitude
- Getter `activeStatusLabels` — returns list of display strings for UI
- Helper `addStatusEffect(StatusEffect)` — adds to list following stacking rules
- Helper `removeExpiredEffects()`
- Helper `tickDoTs()` — returns total DoT damage this turn
- Helper `clearStatusEffects()` — called at combat init to reset between fights

### Enemy (`lib/models/enemy.dart`)

**Remove:**
- `isVulnerable`
- `tempAttackMultiplier`
- `tempAttackDebuffTurns`
- `isStunned`

**Keep (non-status-effect uses):**
- `attackMultiplier` — still used by boss enrage mechanic (+10% attack per round after round 15) and Shadow summon passive (-10% attack per turn). These are not debuffs applied by abilities, so they don't belong in the status effect system. Renamed to `enrageMultiplier` for clarity.
- `defenseMultiplier` — keep for symmetry with attackMultiplier, in case future mechanics need it. Renamed to `baseDefenseMultiplier`.

**Add:**
- `List<StatusEffect> statusEffects`
- Same getters and helpers as Character (effective stats, status checks, tick/remove)
- `effectiveAttack` layers: base attack × enrageMultiplier → then weakened reduction from status effects
- `effectiveDefense` layers: base defense × baseDefenseMultiplier → then exposed reduction from status effects

### Shadow Summon Migration

The Shadow summon currently mutates `e.attackMultiplier` directly (-10% per turn, floor 50%). After migration, it will mutate `e.enrageMultiplier` instead. This is NOT a status effect — it's a permanent passive reduction applied by the summoner's Shadow companion, and it stacks multiplicatively each turn. It stays as direct field mutation on the renamed field.

### Help Dialog Update

`help_dialogs.dart` currently reads `enemy.attackMultiplier` and `enemy.defenseMultiplier` to display stat modifications. Update to read from the renamed fields (`enrageMultiplier`, `baseDefenseMultiplier`) and also display active status effects from the `statusEffects` list.

### Existing Player Abilities Migration

All existing player abilities that apply debuffs to enemies get migrated to `appliesStatusEffects`. Player buff abilities (`attackBuffPercent`, `defenseBuffPercent`, `grantCasterDefensePercent`) remain unchanged — they continue to modify the Character's combat multiplier fields.

**Debuff field migration (remove old fields from Ability after migration):**
- `stunChance` → `appliesStatusEffects: [{stunned, 1, 0, stunChance%}]`
- `appliesVulnerability` → `appliesStatusEffects: [{vulnerable, -1, 15, 100%}]`
- `enemyAttackDebuffPercent` → `appliesStatusEffects: [{weakened, -1, percent, 100%}]`
- `enemyDefenseDebuffPercent` → `appliesStatusEffects: [{exposed, -1, percent, 100%}]`
- `tempEnemyAttackDebuffPercent` + `debuffDuration` → `appliesStatusEffects: [{weakened, duration, percent, 100%}]`

**Ability fields to remove after migration:**
- `stunChance`, `appliesVulnerability`, `enemyAttackDebuffPercent`, `enemyDefenseDebuffPercent`, `tempEnemyAttackDebuffPercent`, `debuffDuration`

**Ability fields to keep (player buff mechanics):**
- `attackBuffPercent`, `defenseBuffPercent`, `grantCasterDefensePercent`, `lifeDrain`, `darkPact`, `healPercentMaxHp`, `healScalesWithDefense`, `summonId`, `isPhysicalAttack`, `rogueDualStrike`, `chaotic`, `hitCount`, `minTargets`, `maxTargets`

## 3. Combat Service Changes (`lib/services/combat_service.dart`)

### Unified Turn Processing

Replace all inline status effect logic (isStunned checks, tempAttackMultiplier ticking, isVulnerable bonus) with the unified processing order defined in Section 1. The processing order in Section 1 is the single source of truth — do not duplicate it here.

Key changes to combat_service.dart:
- Remove all direct reads of `enemy.isStunned`, `enemy.isVulnerable`, `enemy.tempAttackMultiplier`, `enemy.tempAttackDebuffTurns`
- Replace with status effect getters and `tickDoTs()` / `removeExpiredEffects()` calls
- Damage formula uses `target.effectiveDefense` and `attacker.effectiveAttack` (which factor in status effects on top of existing combat multipliers)
- All player ability debuff application routes through `appliesStatusEffects` instead of inline field mutation

### Template Factory Fix

`_enemyFromTemplate` in `game_state_provider.dart` currently cherry-picks ability fields. It must be updated to copy the full `Ability` object (including the new `appliesStatusEffects` list) — either by passing the Ability directly or using a `copyWith` pattern. Without this fix, all enemy special abilities lose their status effects at runtime.

### Stat Computation

All damage/defense calculations use the `effective*` getters which factor in active status effects. For Characters, the effective stat computation layers: base stat → combat multiplier (buffs/map modifiers) → status effect reduction (debuffs). For Enemies, the effective stat computation layers: base stat → enrageMultiplier/baseDefenseMultiplier → status effect reduction (debuffs).

### Enemy AI Targeting

Enemy AI continues to pick random alive targets for special abilities — no smart targeting based on existing status effects. This keeps the AI simple and predictable for the player. If an enemy applies stun to an already-stunned target, it just refreshes the duration per stacking rules.

### Ability.copyWith Update

`Ability.copyWith` must be updated to include the new `appliesStatusEffects` field, since it's used by `_enemyFromTemplate` and other copy patterns.

## 4. Custom Map Enemies

### Architecture

**Map definition change** (`lib/data/map_data.dart`):
Each map definition gets a `customEnemies` field — a list of 2 `EnemyTemplate` references.

**Enemy data** (`lib/data/enemy_data.dart`):
New section of custom enemy templates. Stats are defined at a base level and scaled at runtime.

**Scaling formula:**
```
Custom enemy stats = tier base stats × 1.2
Custom enemy XP = tier XP × 1.15
Custom enemy gold = tier gold × 1.15
```

Where "tier" is determined by which slot (1-8) the map lands in during a run. "Tier base stats" means the average stats of the 3 generic enemies in that tier. Custom enemies are defined as scaling templates (like army soldiers), not as fixed stat blocks — their actual stats are computed at encounter time based on the map's tier slot.

**initCombat integration:** `clearStatusEffects()` must be called during `initCombat` for all combatants to ensure no effects carry over from previous fights.

**Encounter generation** (`lib/services/map_service.dart`):
When building a combat encounter for a map node, custom map enemies are added to the pool alongside generic tier enemies. Not every fight will have one — they're mixed in randomly.

### Full Custom Enemy Roster (60 enemies)

Each has a basic attack (singleEnemy) + one special ability with status effects. All special abilities are **singleEnemy** target type unless explicitly marked as **(AOE)**. Special abilities have 50% refresh chance unless otherwise noted. Map IDs are non-sequential because they follow the category-based scheme from map_data.dart.

## 6. Combat UI Changes (`lib/ui/screens/combat/combat_screen.dart`)

### Status Bar Display

Add a text line below the HP bar for both allies and enemies:

```
HP 84/120
Poisoned · Weakened
```

- Font: same labelSmall style, fontSize 8-9
- Color coding by category:
  - Red: DoTs (poisoned, burning, bleeding)
  - Yellow: Debuffs (weakened, exposed, slowed)
  - Blue/Cyan: Control (stunned, blinded, silenced, frozen, cursed)
- Multiple effects separated by " · "
- Only shown when effects are active (no empty line)

---

## 7. Design Principles

- **Tier 1-3** enemies: single status effects — simple, learnable
- **Tier 4-5** enemies: start getting combo effects (two statuses)
- **Tier 6-8** enemies: all combo effects — appropriately threatening for endgame
- **Bosses**: status effects on AOE abilities for maximum party-wide impact
- **Custom map enemies**: 120% stat scaling, one special + one basic attack
- **Special ability refresh**: 40-60% so enemies don't spam every turn
- **Status durations**: 1-3 turns, nothing permanently crippling
- **Each map's custom pair**: one brawler-type, one caster/tricky type for variety
